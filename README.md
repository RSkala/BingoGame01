This was an original concept I had for a quick-playing Bingo game a while back. I originally built it in pure Unity UI (UGUI) as an experiment, and I recently found it on an old hard drive (like my [Keno Game](https://github.com/RSkala/KenoGame_OG)). I wanted to rebuild it using actual bingo assets.

I still need to implement a proper game over and game loop.
